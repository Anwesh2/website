<h2><a href="http://astroml.org">AstroML</a></h2>
<p>AstroML is a Python module for machine learning and data mining in
Astronomy and Astrophysics.  It contains many commonly-used tools from
the astronomical literature, and hundreds of examples of their use.  I
wrote this package to accompany our textbook, <i>Statistics, Data Mining,
and Machine Learning in Astronomy</i>.</p>

<h2><a href="http://scikit-learn.org">Scikit-Learn</a></h2>
<p>Scikit-Learn is a powerful and extensive machine learning library
written in Python.  I have
contributed in many areas of the project, but primarily in the area of
generalized N-point problems & manifold learning.</p>

<h2><a href="http://scipy.org">Scipy</a></h2>
<p>Scipy is a collection of Python tools for scientific computing.  My main
contributions have been in the sparse matrix toolkit, primarily in iterative
sparse matrix decompositions and fast graph algorithms.</p>

<p>AstroAuthorQuery is a small Google-Chrome plugin I wrote to allow for
convenient Astronomy/Astrophysics literature searches from the address bar.</p>
