<h1>Research</h1>
<hr/>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>After completing my undergraduate studies in Physics at Calvin College, I
took a few years off before returning to academia. In those years I lived in
Sendai, Japan, where I taught English at a non-profit student center, then
returned to the US and spent two years as an outdoor educator with Mount
Hermon Outdoor Science School (just outside Santa Cruz, CA) and Summit
Adventure (just outside Yosemite). Those two years working and teaching
outdoors among the Redwoods, Sequoias, granite peaks, and dark skies rekindled
my interest in science in general, and Astronomy in particular. I began my
doctoral studies at the UW in 2006. When not working on my research, I enjoy
growing food in my garden, training and competing in local triathlons, and
playing bluegrass mandolin.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
I started my PhD with a vague interest in cosmology, and a hope to land in an 
institution with the resources to learn more. UW offered plenty of
opportunities in that area.

<ul>
<li><b>Type Ia Supernovae</b><br>
After beginning my graduate studies, I quickly became involved in the SDSS-II
supernova team. The project had the advantage of being very sensitive to events
in the so-called "redshift desert" between z=0.05 and z=0.4. Under the guidance
of PI Rick Kessler, we used the first-year results as a background to do the 
first serious comparison of systematic effects of the two of the leading 
light-curve fitters.</li>

<li><b>Machine Learning/Open Source Software</b><br>
In 2008 I began exploring a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique
called Locally Linear Embedding (LLE). LLE has been broadly studied in various
fields relating to computer perception, and we showed that it is useful in 
processing galaxy spectra. In particular, the dimensionality reduction is 
sensitive to nonlinear effects that are lost by more familiar techniques such 
as PCA. I ended up submitting a version of this code to the open source
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) project, and have remained involved.
I've since invested a lot of energy into other open source
Python projects in the realm of machine learning, data mining, and
visualization, and have co-authored a
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Data-Mining-Machine-Learning-Astronomy/dp/0691151695">textbook</a>
on these subjects, focusing on applications to astronomy and astrophysics.</li>

<li><b>Weak Gravitational Lensing</b><br>
My PhD dissertation work was in the area of Weak Gravitational Lensing.
Working with Andy Connolly at UW, as well as Bhuvnesh Jain and
Mike Jarvis at University of Pennsylvania, I explored ways in which data
compression and noise filtration algorithms similar to PCA could be used
in generating mass maps and computing cosmological constraints from weak
lensing shear catalogs.

<li><b>Observational Probes of Scalar/Tensor Gravity Theories</b><br>
In collaboration with collaborators at the University of
Pennsylvania, I've published several papers exploring small-scale effects
of modifications to General Relativity (GR) which might be behind the
accelerated expansion of the universe.  To be consistent with Solar System
observations, these theories must allow any fifth-force effects to be
somehow screened within our own galaxy so that GR is recovered.  These
screening mechanisms lead to some interesting dynamical and morphological
consequences in the case of isolated dwarf galaxies.  We've been exploring
observations which might constrain the strength of these modifications.

<li><b>Astronomy Education: UW Planetarium</b><br>
During my graduate career, I was involved in the University of
Washington Planetarium in a variety of positions. For two years, I oversaw our
K-12 outreach program, providing free planetarium shows to school groups from
the greater Seattle area. Later, I spent two years managing and coordinating the
installation of a new digital projection system in the planetarium, built upon 
World Wide Telescope in collaboration with Microsoft Research (see a feature 
on the project <a href="http://artsci.washington.edu/newsletter/March11/Planetarium.asp">here</a>). Through these opportunities, I had the chance to 
facilitate hands-on exploration of the universe with thousands of people both 
in Seattle and around the country.</li>

<li><b>NSF Fellowship</b><br>
During 2013, I was a post-doctoral fellowship through the NSF's Transformative
Computational Infrastructure program (CI-TraCS), and worked at UW jointly
between the Computer Science department's Database Group, and the Astronomy
department's survey science group. I worked primarily on ways to utilize
advances from the field of database research to enable new approaches to
data-intensive areas of Astronomy and Astrophysics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Current</h2>
In January 2014, I begun working as the Director of Research in Physical
Sciences for UW's eScience Institute.  In this role, I will have the
opportunity to collaborate with colleagues in many areas of research --
More details to come!
