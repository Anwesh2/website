<h1>Research</h1>
<hr/>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>After completing my undergraduate studies in Physics at Calvin College, I
took a few years off before returning to academia. In those years I lived in
Sendai, Japan, where I taught English at a non-profit student center, then
returned to the US and spent two years as an outdoor educator with Mount
Hermon Outdoor Science School (just outside Santa Cruz, CA) and Summit
Adventure (just outside Yosemite). Those two years working and teaching
outdoors among the Redwoods, Sequoias, granite peaks, and dark skies rekindled
my interest in science in general, and Astronomy in particular. I began my
doctoral studies at the UW in 2006. When not working on my research, I enjoy
growing food in my garden, training and competing in local triathlons, and
playing bluegrass mandolin.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
I started my PhD with a vague interest in cosmology, and a hope to land in an 
institution with the resources to learn more. UW offered plenty of
opportunities in that area.

<ul>
<li><b>Type Ia Supernovae</b><br>
After beginning my graduate studies, I quickly became involved in the SDSS-II
supernova team. The project had the advantage of being very sensitive to events
in the so-called "redshift desert" between z=0.05 and z=0.4. Under the guidance
of PI Rick Kessler, we used the first-year results as a background to do the 
first serious comparison of systematic effects of the two of the leading 
light-curve fitters.</li>

<li><b>Machine Learning/Open Source Software</b><br>
In 2008 I began exploring a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique
called Locally Linear Embedding (LLE). LLE has been broadly studied in various
fields relating to computer perception. We showed that it is useful in 
processing galaxy spectra. In particular, the dimensionality reduction is 
sensitive to nonlinear effects that are lost by more familiar techniques such 
as PCA. The LLE code I developed is publicly available within the SSG pages. 
In addition, this interest in machine learning and data visualization has led
to my involvement in a number of python open source packages, including
contribution of efficient sparse matrix routines in scipy and contribution
of a host of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to
scikit-learn. I am actively involved as a member of the scikit-learn
organization, collaborating regularly with CS researchers from around the 
world in porting efficient machine learning algorithms to python.</li>

<li><b>Weak Gravitational Lensing</b><br>
Mentored by Andrew Connolly and Bhuvnesh Jain (U.Penn), my PhD thesis research
involved efficient algorithms for the extraction of cosmological information 
from weak lensing shear data. Leveraging fast matrix-manipulation algorithms, 
we re-expressed many aspects of the problem in terms of linear systems, which 
can be solved very quickly. My work has addressed 3D tomographic mass-mapping,
interpolation of masked shear fields, improved signal-to-noise filtering in 
shear peak statistics, and alternative methods of obtaining cosmological 
parameter constraints from two-point information of shear observations.

<li><b>Observational Probes of Scalar/Tensor Gravity Theories</b><br>
In collaboration with Bhuvnesh Jain and others at the University of
Pennsylvania, I've published several papers exploring small-scale effects
of modifications to General Relativity (GR) which might be behind the
accelerated expansion of the universe.  To be consistent with Solar System
observations, these theories must allow any fifth-force effects to be
somehow screened within our own galaxy so that GR is recovered.  These
screening mechanisms lead to some interesting dynamical and morphological
consequences in the case of isolated dwarf galaxies.  We've been exploring
observations which might constrain the strength of these modifications.

<li><b>Astronomy Education: UW Planetarium</b><br>
During my graduate career, I was involved in the University of
Washington Planetarium in a variety of positions. For two years, I oversaw our
K-12 outreach program, providing free planetarium shows to school groups from
the greater Seattle area. Later, I spent two years managing and coordinating the
installation of a new digital projection system in the planetarium, build upon 
World Wide Telescope in collaboration with Microsoft Research (see a feature 
on the project <a href="http://artsci.washington.edu/newsletter/March11/Planetarium.asp">here</a>). Through these opportunities, I had the chance to 
facilitate hands-on exploration of the universe with thousands of people both 
in Seattle and around the country.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Current</h2>
I am currently on a post-doctoral fellowship through the NSF's Transformative
Computational Infrastructure program (CI-TraCS), and work at UW jointly between
the Computer Science department's Database Group, and the Astronomy department's
survey science group. I'm primarily thinking about ways to utilize advances
from the field of database research to enable new approaches to
data-intensive areas of Astronomy and Astrophysics.
